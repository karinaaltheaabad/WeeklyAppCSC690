# Weekly App -- Final CSC 690

Project by: Karina A, Fiona G., Allan N., Daisy S.

Background: 

Since Covid 19, it has been difficult to put a structure behind our tasks as we have numerous things to do while staying in our home, with potential responsibilities even there. Prior to the pandemic, it was easier to focus on tasks that needed to be done for school as there was structure and a place for us to go to class, study and collaborate with school mates, teachers and friends. 

Purpose: 

We created an app that would somehow easily provide structure into a student's day by setting 6 each day frame, morning, noon and night into 6 hour increments, so that we are able to loosely segregate our tasks while providing some form of structure for the day. 

Goal: 

-The user must have a way to list all his necessary tasks to be done divided up into several parts of the day. 
-The app must be minimal in design as it is necessary for users to be able to see clearly their list and go through them for the day. 
-The app must show one day only to prevent clutter in the small screen of a mobile phone
-The user must be able to delete tasks that are done. 
-The user must be able to list tasks that are needed to do within the certain time frame alloted. 

Pitfalls: 

The group was able to follow everything else except being able to store the data within each TableView, so when the user exits the specific page screen, the data gets lost and resets, and being able to fully implement MVC to the app due to time constraints. 


Summary: 

There has been a lot of improvement in terms of coding and being to work with the Swift Language and XCode. Each of us definitely have a lot more room for improvement and growth, but this enabled us to be able to get our feet wet in the world of iOS app development.
